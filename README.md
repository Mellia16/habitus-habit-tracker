# habitus-habit-tracker

Habitus is a simple habit tracker I built in Swift as part of my early learning journey. It may look basic, but for me, it reflects something bigger: the mindset of learning consistently and building discipline through small, steady steps.

The program tracks five personal habits I set for myself—reading, coding, watching something inspirational, praying on time, and exercising. Instead of being hardcoded, it lets the user input yes/no responses, making the experience more interactive. At the end, it calculates how many habits were completed and shows progress for the day.

This project is not just about code. It’s about showing that even with limited time, tools, and experience, I can take what I’ve learned—variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops—and turn it into something that works. It’s proof that learning Swift isn’t just theory for me, but practice.

For me, Habitus is more than a tracker—it’s a reminder that every small effort counts, whether in coding or in life.
